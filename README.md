**Part of [palStack](https://palstack.io)** - Privacy-first tools for everyday life

---

## The Story Behind pantryPal

We're **palStack**—a small team building privacy-first tools for everyday life. pantryPal is where it all started.

The problem was simple and annoying: one of us kept buying duplicate groceries. Three cans of tomato sauce in a month. Expired food forgotten in the basement. Wasted money, wasted food, endless frustration.

"Can't you just... build something?"

So we did. 

What started as a fix for one household's pantry chaos quickly caught on with friends. They saw it working and wanted in. Before we knew it, we were running pantryPal for multiple households—each with their own setup, preferences, and stories about the food waste they'd avoided.

That's when it clicked: this isn't just our problem. It's *everyone's* problem.

**The Home Automation Touch**  
We added contact sensors to pantry doors. Open the pantry, get a gentle Home Assistant notification reminding you to log what you took out. No more "I grabbed something but forgot to update it" moments. Our friends loved this trick and started doing it too.

**Learning as We Go**  
Here's the honest truth: none of us came from software engineering backgrounds. We're learning this stuff as we build it—backend design, microservices, mobile apps, Docker networking. Some days it's FastAPI patterns. Other days it's debugging why containers won't talk to each other at 2 AM.

We use AI coding assistants heavily. Not to write the code *for* us, but to help us understand *why* things work the way they do. It's like having a patient teacher who doesn't judge when you ask the same question three different ways.

Is pantryPal over-engineered for what it does? Probably. Does it work? Absolutely. Are we still figuring things out? Every single day.

**Why Open Source?**  
As more friends adopted pantryPal, we kept refining it—better multi-user support, smoother mobile experience, easier self-hosting. Eventually we realized: why keep this just for people we know?

We founded **palStack** to share these tools with anyone who wants them. pantryPal is our first production-ready Pal, built on a simple idea: everyday problems deserve privacy-first, self-hosted solutions that actually work.

Once you solve one household problem with code, you start seeing opportunities everywhere. pantryPal was just the beginning—a collection of practical tools for managing everyday life without giving up your data.

## Shared Household Model

pantryPal is designed for **household use** - one instance serves one household with shared data and individual preferences.

### How It Works

| Data Type | Scope | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Pantry Items** | Shared | One pantry for the whole household |
| **Shopping List** | Shared | Everyone adds to and checks off the same list |
| **Recipes** | Shared | All users see the same imported recipes |
| **Recipe Favorites** | Per-user | Each user has their own favorites list |
| **Recipe Notes** | Per-user | Personal notes visible only to you |
| **Recipe Integrations** | Admin-only | Mealie/Tandoor setup requires admin |

### User Management

**Registration is disabled by default.** The admin creates accounts for household members:

1. Admin logs in and goes to **Admin → Users**
2. Click **Create User** and enter their email
3. User receives an email invitation to set their password
4. User logs in and can immediately access the shared pantry and recipes

### Admin Responsibilities

Admins can:
- Create, edit, and delete user accounts
- Promote/demote users to admin status (must have at least one admin)
- Configure recipe integrations (Mealie, Tandoor)
- Configure OIDC authentication providers
- Access system statistics and user management

**Important:** The last admin cannot be demoted - there must always be at least one admin.

### Recipe Integrations

Connect to external recipe managers to import recipes for the whole household:

- **Mealie** - Self-hosted recipe manager
- **Tandoor** - Self-hosted recipe manager

Only admins can configure integrations, but all users can:
- View imported recipes
- Import new recipes (any user)
- Delete recipes (any user)
- Add recipes to their personal favorites
- Add private recipe notes
- Mark recipes as cooked
- See which recipes can be made with available ingredients
- Find recipes that use expiring items
- Add missing ingredients to shopping list

---

## Mobile App Access

The iOS app is currently in TestFlight for community testing. Android app is in active development.

**Features:**
- Native iOS experience (Android coming soon)
- Barcode scanning with camera
- Biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint)
- Self-hosted server configuration
- Full inventory management on the go
- Tested and refined by our growing community of users

---

## Home Assistant Integration

### Quick Setup

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: Pantry Expiring Items
    resource: http://YOUR_SERVER_IP/api/stats/expiring?days=7
    headers:
      X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    value_template: "{{ value_json.summary.total_expiring }}"
    json_attributes:
      - summary
      - items
    scan_interval: 3600
```

### Generate API Key

1. Log in to PantryPal web interface
2. Go to Settings
3. Scroll to "API Keys" section
4. Click "Generate New API Key"
5. Give it a name (e.g., "Home Assistant")
6. Copy the key and use it in your Home Assistant configuration

### Example Automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Morning Pantry Check"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "09:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.pantry_expiring_items
        above: 0
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Pantry Alert"
          message: "{{ states('sensor.pantry_expiring_items') }} items expiring soon"
```

---

## Roadmap

**Near Term:**
- [ ] Android native app (currently in development)
- [ ] Home Assistant voice control integration
- [ ] Receipt scanning with LLM processing for bulk entry
- [ ] Shopping list generation from pantry

**Future:**
- [ ] Meal planning based on inventory
- [ ] Nutrition tracking
- [x] Recipe suggestions based on available items (via Mealie/Tandoor integration)
- [ ] Cross-Pal integration (propertyPal, finPal, clubPal)

**palStack Vision:**
All our Pals will eventually work together seamlessly—imagine your grocery spending syncing with finPal, or maintenance costs flowing into your budget automatically.

---

## Why Self-Hosted?

Because your pantry inventory is your personal data. You shouldn't need:
- A subscription to track your own groceries
- Permission from a cloud service to access your data
- Internet connectivity to know what's in your basement

Self-hosting means:
- Complete privacy and control
- No recurring costs
- Works offline
- Integrate with anything
- Modify as needed
